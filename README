I'm a newbie and this is my first repos in github. Sorry if the code is not structured.

THe basic idea is to have your tweet to reach a group of phones.
If you are a principal of a college, and wanna send SMS to all your staffs, this is the app for u.
Just make a tweet on twitter, this app will send SMS to all ppl u wanna send it to.

The main.php file gets all info from mysql db. It also uses a twitter API to get the latest tweets.
You can make changes to the URL of the twitter api with respect to https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1

If you have any clarifications, mail me at vsethuooo@gmail.com

I'll attach the set of db queries to set up your mysql db
